<h4>My favourite place in the world is: Silicy, Italy.</h4>
<p>
    Italy's largest island, Sicily offers exceptional beaches, charming villages and towns, as well as an <b>abundance of ancient ruins and 
        archeological sites aces the warm waters of the Mediterranean.</b>
Throughout history, Sicily has been at the crossroad of cultures, landscapes and cuisine.

    <b>Sicily has its share of natural wonders, too, with Mount Etna ranking as continental Europe's tallest active volcano, 
        and the nightly display from Stromboli, in the neighboring Aeolian Islands, its most dependable. </b>
        Beyond its tourist attractions, you'll enjoy Sicily for its lively local culture and spirited people.
