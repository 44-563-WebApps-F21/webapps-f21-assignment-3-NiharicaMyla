<h1>Dianella</h1>
<p>
My superhero name is Dianella. She can hypnotise anyone by looking at them and can make anyone do anything. 
Dianella has never used her power for advantage. She was born in poor family and her abilities started growing after her mother died. 
She always wanted a normal life. She has friends and best friends whom she can trust.
